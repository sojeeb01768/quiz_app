What actually I used to amke this project:
=> React framework/library.
=> Tailwind css
=> Used Github to save code.
=> Deploy this site on Netlify.


What Is the feature of this Project:
This is actually a exam taking site. Here you can test yourself giving exam on many topics.
=> Firstly set some data of some topics for exam(use loader to get data from API)
=> You can choose or select any topic that you like.
=> There will be provided some question .
=> Every question have 4 options and you can choose one of them.
=> If you select right option a toast will show you the "answer is correct".
=> But if you select wrong option then it will show you "Incorrect Answer"
=> There is also a icon right side of every quetion 
=> If you click the icon it will show you the correct answer of the question.
