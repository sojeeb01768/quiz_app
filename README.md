This is actually a exam taking site. Here you can test yourself giving exam on many topics. <br>
=> Firstly set some data of some topics for exam(use loader to get data from API) <br>
=> You can choose or select any topic that you like. <br>
=> There will be provided some question . <br>
=> Every question have 4 options and you can choose one of them. <br>
=> If you select right option a toast will show you the "answer is correct". <br>
=> But if you select wrong option then it will show you "Incorrect Answer" <br>
=> There is also a icon right side of every quetion. <br> 
=> If you click the icon it will show you the correct answer of the question. </p>
